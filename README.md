# book_api
DockerHub image repository: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rgb234/book_api/general <br></br>

This project was created to simulate a client-server architecture operating on a container environment.  
client : booksearch (flutter) , server : book_api (https://github.com/RGB234/book_api) (express.js)  

The server is implemented through the 'main.js' file  
and just imitates a server by sending and receiving requests to Naver Open API.
